\section{The Intermediate Value Theorem}

The Intermediate Value Theorem simply states that if $f(x)$ is a continuous function on the interval $[a,b]$, then it takes on any given value between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$. In other words, if $f(x)$ is a continuous function, then any horizontal line between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ intersects the graph of $f(x)$. Note that this theorem does not give the number or location of such intersections.
