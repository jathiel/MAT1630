\section{Linear Approximations}

In a calculus course, it is shown that the best linear approximation to a differentiable function $f(x)$ near $x=a$ is given by $L_a(x)=f'(a)(x-a)+f(a)$. We will make use of this general idea to try to approximate solutions of equations of the form $f(x)=0$. 

The Desmos interactive graph below gives an example of a linear approximation to a differentiable function.

\section{Newton's Method}

Suppose that $f(x)$ is a differentiable function and that we would like to solve the equation $f(x)=0$. Using the IVT, or a graphical method, we might have an initial guess for a solution that we will call $x_0$. We are interested in finding a value $r$ such that $f(r)=0$. We know that if $r$ and $x_0$ are ``close" to each other, then $$f(r)\approx f'(x_0)(r-x_0)+f(x_0).$$ Setting the right-hand side above equal to 0, solving for $r$ in terms of $x_0$, and renaming $r$ as $x_1$ gives that $$x_1=x_0-\frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)}.$$ Iterating this process gives that $$x_n=x_{n-1}-\frac{f(x_{n-1})}{f'(x_{n-1})}$$ for $n\geq 1$.  

We can iterate the above proceduce until $|f(x_n)|$ becomes as small as we like. The Desmos interactive graph below gives an example of Newton's method iterated twice.

Before we go over the algorithm for Newton's Method, we must note a disadvantage of this method. Unlike the Binomial Method, Newton's Method may not converge (try applying the method to $f(x)=x^{1/3}$). We must therefore specify a maximum number of iterations we are willing to compute to ensure that the algorithm terminates.

We can summarize Newton's Method using the following flowchart. Here we assume that $f(x)$ is differentiable, that $f'(x)\neq 0$, that $x_0$ is close to a solution of $f(x)=0$, that $n$ is the maximum number of iterationswe are willing to compute, and that $error>0$.

Converting this flowchart to code gives the following:

\begin{verbatim}
==============================
def newton(f,df,x0,n,error):
	x = x0
	i = 0
        while abs(f(x)) > error and i <= n:
                x = x - f(x)/df(x)
                i += 1
        if i > n:
                return "Exceeded iterations"
        else:
                return x
==============================
\end{verbatim}

While Newton's Method may fail to converge, one reason to use it is that can converge to a solution faster than the Binomial Method.
