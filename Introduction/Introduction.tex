Welcome to the MAT1630 Ximera pages. This is a work in progress that will be updated as the semester goes on. The goal of these documents is to introduce course concepts along with problems that you can practice online in a single location. 
This introduction is designed to give a brief overview of the course.

What is this course about?

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Solving mathematical problems with the help of a computer.
	\item Learning to tackle large problems by decomposing them into smaller sub-problems.
	\item Learning to recognize patterns and similarities between different types of problems.
	\item Practicing the process of abstracting and distilling a problem away from its original setting.
	\item Designing algorithms to solve interesting problems.
\end{enumerate}

In this course we will be learning to use Python to help us solve problems. Disclaimer: this is not a programming course. It is not expected that you be a Python expert at the end of the course. The goal is to learn enough Python to help you solve otherwise difficult problems. We will be skipping over several details in favor of practicality.
