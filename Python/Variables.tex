\section{Variables}

Variables act as placeholders for data. Together which functions, covered in a later section, variables help us generalize our algorithms. While you may be used to variables such as \verb|x| or \verb|y| from your math courses, variable names in programming languages can be longer with the aim of being descriptive. When choosing variable names, be sure to keep in mind the following guidelines:

\begin{itemize}
	\item variable names should be descriptive
	\item variable names cannot begin with a number
	\item other than the first letter restriction, variable names can contain any alphanumerica character or \verb|_|
	\item variable names are case sensitive, for example, \verb|myVar| and \verb|myvar| are not the same
\end{itemize}
