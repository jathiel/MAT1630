\section{If/Else}

In an earlier section we saw that in order to compute the absolute value of a real number $x$, we first needed to determine if it satisfied a certain condition, namely, is it the case that $x>0$? The answer to this question then determine the set of instructuctions to follow. We can reformulate our algorithm for computing $|x|$ as two statements in the following way:

For any real number $x$, if $x>0$, then $|x|=x$. Else (or otherwise), $|x|=-x$.

The `if' portion of the statement explains what to do if the given condition is satisfied, while the `else' portion explains what to do if the given condition is not satisfied. This can be easily mapped to the flowchart for computing $|x|$.

In Python we can implement this short algorithm using the following syntax:

\begin{verbatim}
if (condition):
	code1
else:
	code2
\end{verbatim}

The term \verb|condition| indicates the condition we wish to check. If the condition evaluates to \verb|True|, then the instructions given by \verb|code1| are followed. If the condition evaluates to \verb|False|, then the instructions given by \verb|code2| are followed. Note that in Python, whitespace (indentation) determines which lines of code belong to a particular code block.
