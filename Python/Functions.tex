\section{Functions}

The distance between any two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ in the plane is given by $\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2}.$

Suppose you are given the points $p_1=(1,2)$, $p_2=(-5,0)$, $p_3=(-4,4)$, $p_4=(-3,2)$ and are asked to find the maximum distance between any two. To accomplish this in a single program with what we have covered so far would require writing down (essentially) the same code six times, once for each pair $p_1$ and $p_2$, $p_2$ and $p_3$, etc.
