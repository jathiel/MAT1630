\section{Functions}

The distance between any two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ in the plane is given by $\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2}.$ Suppose you are given the points $p_1=(1,2)$, $p_2=(-5,0)$, $p_3=(-4,4)$, $p_4=(-3,2)$ and are asked to find the maximum distance between any two. To accomplish this in a single program with what we have covered so far would require writing down (essentially) the same code six times, once for each pair $p_1$ and $p_2$, $p_2$ and $p_3$, etc. 

A function will help us with the above problem in two ways:

\begin{itemize}
	\item By compartmentalizing code into a function, we can reuse the same set of steps without repeating ourselves.
	\item If there is ever a need to make a change or fix an error, a function provides a singular location where the code can be altered.
\end{itemize}

A Python function will have the following syntax:

\begin{verbatim}
==============================
def functionName(inputs):
	code
	return variable
==============================
\end{verbatim}

The key word \verb|def| denotes the beginning of a function definition. Using the same guidelines for variable names, \verb|functionName| is your choice of the name of the function and will be used to `call' it as needed. A collection of comma separated values in \verb|inputs| will act as the inputs to the function (note that order matters for the inputs). The portion labelled \verb|code| is simply the set of instructions to be completed whenever the function is called. Finally, we have the line with the keyword \verb|return|. So far, we have been using \verb|print| to see the result of a calculation on the screen. In the case of a function, we will likely want the resulting output to be used in {\em another} calculation. The keyword \verb|return| provides us with this ability. Any \verb|variable| after \verb|return| represents the output value of the function and can be assigned to another variable or passed into another function without displaying the value on the screen. The keyword \verb|print|, on the other hand, prints the value to the screen but does not provide us with any data that can be assigned elsewhere. When using \verb|print|, the computer essentially forgets what it just computed.

Below is an example of the function that computes the distance between two points, $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$.

\begin{verbatim}
==============================
def dist(x1,y1,x2,y2):
        d = ((x1-x2)**2+(y1-y2)**2)**(0.5)
	return d
==============================
\end{verbatim}

This function, as long as it is defined before it is called, can now be used multiple times with different inputs to compute the distance between several pairs of points. Below we give an example.

\begin{sageCell}
def dist(x1,y1,x2,y2):
        d = ((x1-x2)**2+(y1-y2)**2)**(0.5)
        return d

x1 = 1
y1 = 2
x2 = -5
y2 = 0
x3 = -4
y3 = 4

print(dist(x1,y1,x2,y2))
print(dist(x1,y1,x3,y3))
print(dist(x2,y2,x3,y3))
\end{sageCell}
